# NeuralTrust Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for NeuralTrust's AI security platform. Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18.0 or above
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
