# Architecture

The NeuralTrust AI Gateway is designed as a modular, scalable system that provides secure access management and monitoring for AI model APIs. This document details the core architectural components and their interactions.

## High-Level Overview

The gateway consists of two main components:

1. Admin API (Port 8080) - For tenant and configuration management
2. Proxy API (Port 8081) - For handling and forwarding requests

## Core Components

### 1. Admin Server

The Admin Server is responsible for managing the gateway's configuration and tenant management. Key features include:

- **Tenant Management**
  - Creation and management of tenant accounts
  - API key generation and rotation
  - Usage quotas and billing configuration
  
- **Provider Configuration**
  - AI provider endpoint configuration
  - Authentication credentials management
  - Model mappings and aliases

- **Policy Management**
  - Access control rules
  - Rate limiting configurations
  - Request routing rules

### 2. Proxy Server

The Proxy Server handles all AI model requests and implements the core routing logic:

- **Request Processing**
  - Authentication validation
  - Request transformation
  - Load balancing
  - Request queuing
  
- **Response Handling**
  - Response validation
  - Error handling
  - Response transformation
  - Metrics collection

### 3. Redis Storage Layer

Redis serves as the central storage system for:

- Configuration data
- Rate limiting counters
- Cache storage
- Session management
- Real-time metrics

### 4. Plugin System

The plugin system provides a modular approach to extending gateway functionality:

- **Pre-processing Plugins**
  - Input validation
  - Content filtering
  - Request transformation
  - Authentication
  
- **Post-processing Plugins**
  - Response validation
  - Content modification
  - Metrics collection
  - Logging

- **Core Plugins**
  - Rate limiting
  - Usage tracking
  - Cost management
  - Load balancing

## Data Flow

1. **Incoming Request**
   - Client sends request to Proxy API
   - Request is authenticated and validated
   - Pre-processing plugins are executed

2. **Request Processing**
   - Request is routed to appropriate AI provider
   - Rate limiting and quotas are checked
   - Request is transformed if needed

3. **Response Handling**
   - Response is received from AI provider
   - Post-processing plugins are executed
   - Metrics are collected
   - Response is returned to client

## Security Architecture

The gateway implements multiple security layers:

- **Authentication**
  - API key validation
  - JWT token support
  - OAuth2 integration (optional)

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based access control
  - Fine-grained permissions
  - IP whitelisting

- **Encryption**
  - TLS for all communications
  - Payload encryption options
  - Key rotation

## Monitoring and Observability

The gateway provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Metrics**
  - Request/response timing
  - Error rates
  - Usage statistics
  - Cost tracking

- **Logging**
  - Structured logging
  - Audit trails
  - Error tracking
  - Debug information

- **Alerting**
  - Usage threshold alerts
  - Error rate monitoring
  - System health checks
  - Cost management alerts

## Scaling Considerations

The gateway is designed to scale horizontally:

- Stateless proxy servers can be replicated
- Redis cluster support for high availability
- Load balancer integration
- Multiple deployment options (Kubernetes, Docker, bare metal)

## Integration Points

The gateway provides multiple integration options:

- **REST APIs**
  - Admin API for configuration
  - Proxy API for requests
  - Metrics API for monitoring

- **Webhooks**
  - Event notifications
  - Status updates
  - Alert integration

- **Custom Plugins**
  - Custom authentication
  - Request/response transformation
  - Business logic integration

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through:

- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Admin API
- Database storage
- Redis cache

This architecture provides a robust foundation for managing AI model access while ensuring security, scalability, and extensibility.
