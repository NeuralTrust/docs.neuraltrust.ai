# Plugins

Plugins are modular components that extend and customize AI Gateway's functionality. The plugin system follows a stage-based execution model, allowing plugins to process requests and responses at different points in the request lifecycle.

## Plugin Architecture

### Execution Stages

The plugin system operates in three main stages:

1. **Pre-Request Stage**
   - Executes before the request reaches the LLM
   - Handles request validation and transformation
   - Manages security and access control
   - Examples: Authentication, rate limiting, input validation

2. **Post-Request Stage**
   - Executes after receiving the LLM response
   - Handles response modification and enrichment
   - Manages response processing and analytics
   - Examples: Response transformation, caching, logging

3. **Error Stage**
   - Handles error conditions and failures
   - Manages error response formatting
   - Provides fallback mechanisms
   - Examples: Error handling, circuit breaking, retry logic

### Execution Flow

Plugin execution follows a structured flow based on:

1. **Priority Levels**
   ```
   Priority 1 (Critical)
        ↓
   Priority 2 (Essential)
        ↓
   Priority 3 (Optional)
   ```

2. **Execution Modes**
   - **Sequential**: Plugins that must run one after another
   - **Parallel**: Plugins that can run concurrently

## Plugin Types

### Sequential Plugins
Plugins that require ordered execution:
- Maintain state across requests
- Depend on other plugin results
- Handle critical security functions
- Examples: Authentication, rate limiting

### Parallel Plugins
Plugins that can run independently:
- Process requests without dependencies
- Perform stateless operations
- Handle non-critical functions
- Examples: Logging, metrics collection

## Plugin Inheritance

Plugins follow a hierarchical inheritance pattern:

```
Gateway Level (Global)
       ↓
Service Level (Service-specific)
       ↓
Route Level (Route-specific)
       ↓
Consumer Group Level (Group-specific)
       ↓
Consumer Level (Individual)
```

More specific configurations override general ones.

## Core Plugin Categories

### 1. Security Plugins
Protect and secure API access:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas
- IP filtering
- Request validation

### 2. Traffic Management
Control and optimize traffic flow:
- Load balancing
- Circuit breaking
- Request routing
- Traffic splitting

### 3. Transformation
Modify requests and responses:
- Request/response transformation
- Content filtering
- Data enrichment
- Protocol conversion

### 4. Observability
Monitor and analyze traffic:
- Logging and tracing
- Metrics collection
- Analytics
- Health checking

## Plugin Chain

The plugin chain defines how plugins work together:

### Chain Structure
```
Authentication → Rate Limiting → Transformation → Logging
     ↑              ↑                ↑              ↑
 Security      Traffic Control    Processing    Observability
```

### Chain Characteristics
- Ordered execution based on priority
- Mix of sequential and parallel plugins
- Configurable at multiple levels
- Flexible and extensible

## Best Practices

### 1. Plugin Organization
- Group related plugins together
- Maintain clear execution order
- Consider plugin dependencies
- Keep chains focused and simple

### 2. Performance Considerations
- Balance security and performance
- Use parallel execution when possible
- Optimize plugin chains
- Consider resource usage

### 3. Security Guidelines
- Layer security plugins properly
- Implement defense in depth
- Handle failures gracefully
- Maintain secure defaults
