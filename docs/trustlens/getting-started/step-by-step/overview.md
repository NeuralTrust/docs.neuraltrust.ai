# Getting Started with LLMs Observability

This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring NeuralTrust to gather data and insights about your LLM applications. By following these steps, you'll learn how to:

1. [Start tracking your LLM](./track-llm.md)
   - How to track your LLM messages and responses.
   - How to send the data to NeuralTrust.
2. [Create a topic classifier](./create-topic-classifier.md)
   - How to create a custom topic classifier for your LLM messages or responses.
3. [Create a custom Monitor](./create-custom-monitor.md)
   - How to create a custom monitor for your LLM.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A NeuralTrust API key.
- NeuralTrust SDK installed. Check the [SDK installation guide](docs/sdks/python-sdk/installation.md) for more information.
- A LLM endpoint to track.

## Time to Complete

These guides should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

## What You'll Build

By the end of these guides, you'll have:

- Your LLM messages and responses are being tracked.
- A custom topic classifier for your LLM messages or responses.
- A custom monitor for your LLM.
