# Trust Gate 

**TrustGate** is a robust security and management layer for Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. It provides comprehensive protection, monitoring, and governance for AI applications while enabling organizations to safely deploy and scale their LLM-powered solutions with confidence.

## What is Trust Gate?

**TrustGate** functions as a specialized system akin to an API Gateway, but it's purpose-built for managing Agents and LLM workloads. While traditional API Gateways serve as intermediaries between clients and backend services, handling key operational tasks, AI Gateways take on these responsibilities with a focus on AI-specific needs:

### Key Features of an AI Gateway:

- **Routing:** Directs requests to the appropriate service or model.
- **Load Balancing:** Ensures even traffic distribution across models or services.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Provides a way to fall back to a different model or service if the primary one is unavailable.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Validates access to ensure secure operations.
- **Rate Limiting:** Controls request volumes to prevent overloading, at both the request and token level.
- **Security:** Protects against injection attacks, data leaks, and other security threats.

## Architecture Overview

The AI Gateway architecture consists of several key components working together to provide secure and efficient AI model access:

    alt="AI Gateway Architecture" 
    width="100%" 
    style={{
      maxWidth: '800px',
      margin: '0 auto',
      display: 'block'
    }} 
  />
</div>

### Key Components:

1. **Control Plane**
   - Admin API: Manages configuration, gateways, upstreams, services, rules, and API keys
   - Config Store: Maintains gateway settings and routing rules
2. **Data Plane**
   - Proxy API: Handles real-time request processing
   - Plugin System: Executes custom logic and transformations

## Why use TrustGate?

TrustGate provides specialized security and management features designed specifically for AI workloads:

1. **Advanced Security Protection**
   - Injection Protection: Detects and blocks various injection attacks including SQL, NoSQL, command injection
   - Code Sanitation: Prevents malicious code execution across multiple programming languages
   - Request Size Limiting: Protects against oversized requests and DoS attacks
   - Content Filtering: Blocks harmful or inappropriate content

2. **Sophisticated Rate Limiting**
   - Request-based Rate Limiting: Controls request volumes at IP, user, and global levels
   - Token Bucket Algorithm: Manages token consumption for AI model interactions
   - Burst Handling: Allows temporary traffic spikes while maintaining overall limits
   - Distributed Rate Limiting: Uses Redis for reliable rate limiting across multiple instances

3. **Intelligent Load Balancing**
   - Multiple Load Balancing Strategies
   - Automatic Failover
   - Health Checking
   - Dynamic Backend Selection

4. **AI-specific Features**
   - Prompt Injection Protection
   - Token Usage Control
   - Model-specific Routing
   - Response Validation
   - Content Moderation

5. **Enterprise Integration**
   - Kubernetes Support
   - Docker Deployment
   - High Availability Setup
   - Horizontal Scaling
   - Configuration Management

TrustGate acts as a comprehensive security and management layer for your AI infrastructure, allowing you to:
- Protect against security threats
- Control resource usage
- Monitor performance
- Manage access
- Scale effectively
- Ensure compliance

This enables organizations to deploy AI applications with confidence, knowing they have the necessary controls and protections in place.
