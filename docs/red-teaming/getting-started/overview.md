# What's Red Teaming for LLMs?

Red teaming is a critical practice for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically challenging their behaviors, safety measures, and potential vulnerabilities. While traditionally associated with security testing, LLM red teaming encompasses both security assessment and functional evaluation of model capabilities.

## Why Red Team LLMs?

### Security Challenges
LLMs can present unique risks and challenges that make security testing essential:

- **Prompt Injection/Jailbreak**: Attackers may attempt to manipulate model behavior through carefully crafted prompts
- **Data Leakage**: Models may inadvertently reveal sensitive training data or confidential information
- **Harmful Outputs**: LLMs could generate inappropriate, biased, or dangerous content

### Functional Evaluation
Beyond security, red teaming helps assess and improve core model capabilities:

- **Task Performance**: Systematic testing of model abilities across different domains
- **Edge Cases**: Identifying scenarios where the model might fail or underperform
- **Consistency**: Evaluating response reliability and logical coherence
- **Domain Expertise**: Assessing knowledge depth and accuracy in specific fields
- **Instruction Following**: Testing model's ability to adhere to complex requirements
